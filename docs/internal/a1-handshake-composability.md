# A1 / Handshake Composability

Last updated: 2026-05-29.

**Invariant:** Delegation evidence ≠ greenlight. A1 verification produces fingerprints and reason codes only. Handshake alone issues one-use greenlights and enforces `gatewayCheck` before any mutation for any `ActionContract.actionType`.

**Action-type agnostic rule:** Use generic placeholders throughout — `ActionContract.actionType`, `gatewayRegistry[actionType]`, `policyPack[origin][actionType]`. `x402_payment.exact` is one proof profile, not the product boundary.

**Decision:** See **D-72** in `docs/internal/decisions.md` (OPP-09 evidence-only integration posture).

## Two trust domains

Objects must not cross trust domains without an explicit, tested mapping. A1 `SignedChain` produces fingerprints, never permission.

### Generic data flow

```text
Agent/runtime presents SignedChain (optional)
  → A1EvidenceVerifier.verify() → DelegationEvidenceRecord (evidence only)
  → intent compile → CandidateAction + delegationEvidenceRef
  → ActionContract for ActionContract.actionType
  → evaluatePolicy → greenlight | refusal | review | halt | quarantine
  → gatewayCheck → VerifiedGatewayCheck | refusal | proof gap
  → downstream mutation attempt (adapter) OR terminal refusal
  → Receipt with separable status layers (below)
```

Golden composition invariants (CI-enforced before A1-1 feature code):

- `validA1Verify && !greenlight` → mutation MUST NOT occur
- `greenlight && !gatewayCheck` → mutation MUST NOT occur
- `validA1Verify alone` → MUST NOT set `mutationAuthorityCreated`

## BORROW (reference only — not implemented in A1-0)

Port or sidecar-verify in A1-1+; do not product-depend on A1 gateway HTTP:

1. **SignedChain wire format** — A1 `wire/schema.json` as normative input
2. **Offline Ed25519 verification** — domain strings pinned; bit-identical to A1 conformance vectors
3. **Chain fingerprint / cert fingerprint** — audit-stable digests for receipts
4. **Multi-hop provenance** — depth, principal public key, terminal delegate public key
5. **Capability narrowing model** — O(1) bitmask pre-check (defer until scale forces)
6. **Verification outcome taxonomy** — structured reason codes (invalid, expired, mismatch, …)
7. **Conformance vectors** — CI gate against A1 test fixtures

Planned module path: `src/integrations/a1-evidence/` (A1-1; absent in A1-0).

## Receipt: three separable status layers

Terminal evidence must never collapse delegation proof, gateway enforcement, and downstream rail outcome into one undifferentiated status.

| Layer                     | Owner                     | Example fields                                    | Must not imply                                |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `delegationProvenance`    | A1 evidence layer (A1-2+) | chainFingerprint, verifyDigest, reasonCodes       | greenlight, gateway pass, payment success     |
| `gatewayCheckStatus`      | Handshake kernel          | passed / refused / proof_gap on exact contract    | delegation validity alone, downstream success |
| `downstreamOutcomeStatus` | Downstream rail / adapter | succeeded / failed / unknown on protected surface | gateway check, delegation proof               |

Auditors must reconstruct which layer failed six months later without re-running live systems.

## Wedge discipline (KILL-10)

A1 strengthens delegation provenance for protected actions; it is not an excuse to skip Handshake wedge discipline or broaden the action catalog in milestone copy. Integration work stays action-type agnostic in architecture and tests; the first runnable golden path may still sequence on one proof profile without redefining the boundary.

---

## Adversarial questions (META-PROMPT)

**1. Agent bypasses the evidence module and calls the gateway directly.**  
The gateway adapter enforces `VerifiedGatewayCheck` bound to the exact `ActionContract` digest. Without a one-use greenlight consumed at `gatewayCheck`, mutation refuses. A1 evidence is not consulted at the gate; bypass skips provenance policy only if the policy pack does not require delegation evidence — it never creates a second mutation path.

**2. Verify returns valid for capability X but contract is action Y.**  
Policy evaluation refuses at `evaluatePolicy` when evidence capability class does not align with `ActionContract.actionType` and exact params. Valid delegation evidence is necessary when required, never sufficient. Wrong action type never receives greenlight.

**3. Greenlight replayed — does A1 evidence create a second mutation path?**  
No. Greenlight consumption is ledgered in Handshake; replay refuses before gateway check. A1 chain fingerprints do not substitute for greenlight consumption (KILL-09). Evidence replay does not mint ambient authority.

**4. MCP tool renamed to sound like authorize — does CI catch it?**  
Yes. `a1-integration-kill-enforcement.test.ts` forbids tool names matching authorize/mint/renew patterns in `src/mcp/catalog.ts` and `server.json`. MCP remains proposal/evidence only (`authorityCreated: false`).

**5. Six months later — delegation vs gateway vs payment success?**  
Receipt export keeps `delegationProvenance`, `gatewayCheckStatus`, and `downstreamOutcomeStatus` as separate fields (KILL-08). Terminal certificates bind to Handshake events, not A1 HTTP clearance.

**6. Same design if actionType is repo.write instead of x402_payment.exact?**  
Yes. Policy packs key on `policyPack[origin][actionType]`; gateway binding uses `gatewayRegistry[actionType]`. Delegation evidence attaches to `CandidateAction`; no x402-only kernel fork.

**7. Verify sidecar down — what is recorded?**  
Proof gap when offline verify is required but unavailable. Missing evidence is proof gap, not smoothed success. Policy may refuse or quarantine; it must not treat HTTP authorize as substitute clearance (KILL-02).
